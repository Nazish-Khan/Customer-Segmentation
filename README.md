# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering

In this project, I utilized Python to perform a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, with a focus on the United Kingdom region. The project encompassed data preparation, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, and K-Means clustering to uncover distinct customer segments. I validated the results using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), achieving perfect scores that confirm robust clustering stability.

The profiling revealed four key customer segments:

Value Seekers (Cluster 0): Customers who purchase frequently and spend moderately. This largest segment highlights opportunities for increasing transaction values through targeted promotions and engagement strategies.
Loyal Frequent Buyers (Cluster 1): Customers who frequently purchase but spend slightly less. They benefit from loyalty programs and targeted promotions to boost their average spend.
High-Value VIPs (Cluster 2): A small group of high-spending, high-engagement customers. Strategies should focus on exclusive offers and exceptional service to maintain their loyalty.
Premium Spenders (Cluster 3): Customers who spend a lot but purchase less frequently. Increasing their engagement could enhance overall revenue.

Incorporating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) further enriched the analysis, offering insights into customer profitability and aiding in tailored marketing strategies. This project demonstrates the power of data mining and analysis in driving business decisions, with applications in retail, e-commerce, and finance for targeted marketing and optimized resource allocation.
