# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-means clustering. Also, I am adding Customer Lifetime Value (CLV Score) to add more insights into the analysis. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups to enhance marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Features
- **RFM Analysis**: Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segment customers based on RFM scores. Later, calculate their CLV scores as well to enhance the customer future insight.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots for segment analysis.

## Usage

1. Load your data and perform RFM analysis.
2. Apply K-means clustering to segment customers.
3. Review results and visualizations in the notebook.
